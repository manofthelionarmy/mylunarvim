# mylunarvim

## Purpose:

The purpose of this repo is to hold my configurations for lunarvim. Lunarvim is an nvim0.5.0+
ide layer. It allows you to configure the ide and add your own plugins. I chose to go with this than
setting up my own nvim. 

The project can be found [here]: https://github.com/LunarVim/LunarVim

## Installation:

Installation steps for lunarvim can be found at the repo. To get the config, clone this into ~/.config/lvim.
Make sure not to delete plugin/packer_compiled.lua
